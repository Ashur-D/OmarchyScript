# OmarchyScript
Apply some tweaks after the Omarchy setup like adding some more programs, changing the cursor, as well as flatpaks (roblox is all I use from that), changing and showing the current power plan, changing some hyprland files to my preference, all in the overrride.conf file

To run the script just cd into the directory and run `bash main.sh`
